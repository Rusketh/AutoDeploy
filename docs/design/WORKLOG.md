# AutoDeploy Worklog

Append-only running log of development work. Newest entries at the bottom.
Each entry: WHAT, WHY (assumption/decision flagged), build STATE, NEXT.

## 2026-05-28 — Phase 0 kickoff

**WHAT.** Initial project scaffolding. Created the three-component layout
(`server/`, `boot-client/`, `agent/`), top-level `README.md`, GitHub Actions
CI workflows for each component, a starter user guide, and this worklog.
Wrote and ran a "hello" build of each component so CI has something to compile.

**WHY (assumptions / decisions).** Phase 0 in the roadmap explicitly calls for
deciding the server technology stack and topology — these were open questions
in the design document. Decisions taken now (logged so they can be cheaply
revisited):

- ASSUMPTION: Server language and framework — **Go 1.22+**, using the standard
  library `net/http` plus minimal dependencies (chi router, pgx for Postgres).
  Reasons: single static binary deploys cleanly to either Windows or Linux
  servers; excellent streaming HTTP for multi-GB ISO/WIM payloads; the same
  toolchain cross-compiles the Linux Boot Client and the Windows agent so the
  whole platform shares one build culture.
- ASSUMPTION: Datastore — **PostgreSQL** for relational artifact metadata,
  bindings, inventory and audit; local filesystem (or S3-compatible later) for
  payload blobs.
- ASSUMPTION: Portal UI — **server-rendered Go html/template + HTMX** for
  interactivity. Avoids a parallel JS toolchain in the initial phases; can be
  replaced with a SPA later if needed. Keeps the portal trivially shippable in
  the same single binary as the API.
- ASSUMPTION: Topology — **single-server** to begin with. Architecture must
  remain open to distributed site servers (Phase 16 revisit).
- DECISION: Each of `server/`, `boot-client/`, `agent/` is its own Go module.
  Independent buildable components per Phase 0 exit criteria.
- DECISION: Logging is structured (`log/slog` JSON) from line one. Every event
  carries `who`, `what`, `where`, `when` (`actor`, `action`, `component` +
  `target`, automatic timestamp). Secret-handling rules are documented in
  `docs/design/CONVENTIONS.md` and enforced by code review and a `forbidden
  identifiers` lint in CI (BitLocker PIN/recovery-key/access-PIN values are
  never accepted by the logger).

**BUILD STATE.** New project — local builds of each component succeed
(`go build ./...` per module). GitHub Actions workflows added but not yet run
against the repository.

**NEXT.** Stand up the server's HTTP skeleton (Phase 0 exit criterion: empty
server, boot client, agent each build and run), confirm CI green on push,
then start Phase 1 (data model and management portal artifacts).
